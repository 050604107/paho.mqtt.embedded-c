# Eclipse Paho MQTT C client for Embedded platforms

This repository contains the source code for the [Eclipse Paho](http://eclipse.org/paho) MQTT C client library for Embedded platorms. 

## Build requirements / compilation

There are helper scripts (build...) in various directories.  The client library is a set of building blocks which you pick and choose from, so that the smallest MQTT application can be built.

## Usage and API

See the samples directory for examples of intended use.


## Runtime tracing

As yet, there is no tracing.  For the smallest client, should we have tracing?


## Reporting bugs

Please report bugs under the "MQTT-C" Component in [Eclipse Bugzilla](http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/) for the Paho Technology project.

## More information

Discussion of the Paho clients takes place on the [Eclipse paho-dev mailing list](https://dev.eclipse.org/mailman/listinfo/paho-dev).

General questions about the MQTT protocol are discussed in the [MQTT Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en-US&fromgroups#!forum/mqtt).

There is much more information available via the [MQTT community site](http://mqtt.org).
